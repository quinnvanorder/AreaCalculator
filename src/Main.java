/*
Write a method named area with one double parameter named radius.
The method needs to return a double value that represents the area of a circle.

If the parameter radius is negative than return -1.0 to represent the invalid value.

Write another overloaded method with 2 parameters x and y (both doubles), where x and y represent the sides of a rectangle.
The method needs to return the area of a rectangle.

If either or both parameters is negative, return -1

TIP: the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is X*Y
TIP: the formula for calculating a circle area is radius * pi
TIP: for pi, use a constant from the math class, Math.PI
